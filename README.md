# GANFaceGen

In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to train a GAN to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

Follow the main jupyter notebook to understand how the sample dataset is loaded and manipulated in order to generate different batches for training purposes! The end goal is to take advantage between these 2 Neural Networks in order to create images that are totally new and as realistic as possible! (Given the proper training of course!)

Just make sure you have the following packages installed in your virtual environment

```
conda install pytorch -c pytorch
pip install torchvision
```
